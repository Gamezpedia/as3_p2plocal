## Synchronized Whiteboard Example

### How it works:

* Run one instance of application. Draw something
* Run another instance within the same network and you will see (after few seconds of loading) the same drawing. From that point all actions with whiteboard would be synchronized.

_P.S. Of course, this app is just example and not safe from simultaneous editing problems)_
